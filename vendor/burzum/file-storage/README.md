The **File Storage** plugin is giving you the possibility to upload and store files in virtually any kind of storage backend. This plugin is wrapping the [Gaufrette](https://github.com/KnpLabs/Gaufrette) library in a CakePHP fashion and provides a simple way to use the storage adapters through the [StorageManager](Lib/StorageManager.php) class.

Storage adapters are an unified interface that allow you to store file data to your local file system, in memory, in a database or into a zip file and remote systems. There is a database table keeping track of what you stored where. You can always write your own adapter or extend and overload existing ones.

**If you're upgrading from CakePHP 2.x please read [the migration guide](docs/Documentation/Migrating-from-CakePHP-2.md).**
